# Tweet Sentiment Analysis for Overall Public Sentiment
by Noah McLean, Sunya Mohammed, and Neil Shah

Our project involves the training of a Word2Vec model and a SGD linear classifier to label tweets with either a negative or positive sentiment, then to use that insight to make broader claims about the effect on public sentiment of actions taken by Nintendo.

To learn more about the project, please refer to 'twitter.ipynb'.
